# Python-Notes

A set of jupyter notebooks created for learning advanced python.

The notes were created using this book:

## [Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do)
### Book by Luciano Ramalho

I highly recommend referring to this book for mastering python and understanding the design principles and compromises Python3 makes in their language.
